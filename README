__swfDevice__: R graphics device for swf (flash) output

__Status__: Pre-Alpha

__Description__: This package provides the swf() graphics device in R.  Using Ming library (http://www.libming.org/) , this device can create flash movies from R plotting commands.  My vision for this device is that multipage output will be rendered as movies with specifiable parameters and optional buttons for control. 

__System Requirements__: Depends on libming version >= 0.4.0beta5.  This version introduced support for ttf fonts without conversion.

__TODO__

* Line types, ljoin, lmitre
* Character metrics (this will be a nightmare)
* Windows support 

__Planned Features__

* Embedded player controls (play, pause, etc.)
	- Customizable at the R level 
* R Bindings to the ming library (will this really be useful?)
	- Control subset of parameters at the R level
