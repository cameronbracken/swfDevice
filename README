swfDevice: R graphics device for swf (flash) output
Status: Pre-Alpha

This package provides the swf() graphics device in R.  Using Ming library (http://www.libming.org/) , this device can create flash movies from R plotting commands.  My vision for this device is that multipage output will be rendered as movies with specifiable parameters and optional buttons for control. 

TODO
* Basically everything
* Implement remaining graphics parameters, especially fill! 
* Text support and character metrics (this will be a nightmare)
* Multipage output
